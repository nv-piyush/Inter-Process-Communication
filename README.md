# Inter-Process-Communication
This is a sample program to get basic idea of inter-process communication with shared memory(read/write operations to same memory locations).

Used system call methods like `shm_open()` to create shared objects, `mmap()` to allocate shared memory for read/write, `fork()` to create child process

Use `readelf`/`objdump` to analyse object file
